**Project Description**
-
- Objective:
The objective of this project is to leverage IoT sensor data to analyze energy consumption
patterns in a commercial building and predict future energy usage. The project aims to:
1. Predict future energy consumption using advanced machine learning models, such as
Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks.
2. Identify anomalies and trends in energy data to derive actionable insights.
3. Develop an interactive dashboard to visualize real-time and historical data, model
predictions, and insights.

**Project Implementation Plan:**
- 
The project is organized into the following phases:
1. Data Preprocessing and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
○ Perform EDA to identify energy consumption trends and anomalies.
○ Prepare the dataset for machine learning by handling missing values, normalizing
data, and creating time-series sequences for LSTM modeling.
2. Model Development:
○ Build and optimize an LSTM-based model for predicting future energy
consumption.
○ Develop a machine learning model for detecting energy usage anomalies or
providing actionable recommendations for energy savings.
3. Insight Generation and Dashboard Development:
○ Extract actionable insights from machine learning models, such as identifying
periods of high energy usage or anomalies.
○ Develop an interactive dashboard using tools like Tableau to visualize trends,
predictions, and comparative energy usage data across devices and building
blocks.
4. Final Deliverables:
○ Machine Learning Models: Code and results from the LSTM model and insights
from anomaly detection.
○ Dashboard: A dashboard showcasing energy trends, predictions, and actionable
insights.
○ Final Report: An APA-style document summarizing the project’s objectives,
methodologies, results, and conclusions.

**Perceived Impact and Utility:**
-

This project can enable building management and policymakers to gain valuable insights into
energy consumption patterns and optimize energy usage. By identifying periods of high demand
and anomalies, the system will improve energy efficiency and contribute to sustainability goals
within the smart city framework.
The project demonstrates how IoT-driven data analytics can transform energy management in
commercial buildings.
